# Hwrites
The program Hwrites can simulate your writing style. Itâ€™s designed to imitate your writing style by using artificial intelligence and text mining.  I'm excited to announce a new breakthrough in machine learning. Hwrites is designed to provide a writing assistant. The program is able to mimic your writing style through AI.

All you have to do is just install the program in any folder
To print in your writing

Step0-> 
By default the program runs in my writing if you want program to mimic in 
your writing you have to write all symbols in plane sheet of paper as show in sample picture, then crop it using slicing tool,
put that in cropped form in myfonts folder if you come across any alignment issue you can use windows paint to align properly.

[Make sure every single image of alphabet is assigned with correct ASCII value number]
