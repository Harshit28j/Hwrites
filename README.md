All you have to do is just install the program in any folder
To print in your writing

Step0-> 
By default the program runs in my writing if you want program to mimic in 
your writing you have to write all symbols in plane sheet of paper as show in sample picture, then crop it using slicing tool,
put that in cropped form in myfonts folder if you come across any alignment issue you can use windows paint to align properly.

[Make sure every single image of alphabet is assigned with correct ASCII value number]

Step1-> 
Open content.txt file write anything you want to mimic in your writing

Step2-> 
Just run the program it will show you image then saves changes and name your image
you're good to go

I'm going to update the cropping stuff soon in the next release stay connected for updates.
